# BadTag-CS-Patcher

Simple modding library I am working on for the Applab GTAG Fangame called: "Bad Tag"
It will include Rig Spamming with Photon, changing the Room Name, Player Names, and your name.
Custom name options, such as: Changing name size, color, font, RGB, rotating/position, and some other options if I can think of it
It will use my custom C# Loader I am STILL WORKING ON, so do NOT ask me about it.
This will be in
