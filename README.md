# BadTag-CS-Patcher

Simple modding library I am working on for the Applab GTAG Fangame called: "Bad Tag"

It will include Rig Spamming with Photon, changing the Room Name, Player Names, and your name.

Custom name options, such as: Changing name size, color, font, RGB, rotating/position, and some other options if I can think of it

It will use my custom C# Loader I am STILL WORKING ON, so do NOT ask me about it.

This will be in either .qmod format, .xml, or possibly just the raw project for you to build yourselves. I won't do a .dll format for one reason, every single UABEA skid will use it resulting in a mass rampage and the developers finding out about this.

# Extra info:
Before you say: "B-b-b-b-b-but oxxx! This is already patched and it's impossible to mod this game!"

I modded gorilla tag for quest didn't I?

I ripped the games source and found a bypass for every single ounce of security. I can use UABEA, Hex editor, and other obfuscated tools to bypass their security, plus.... it sucks...

# We are coming for you Bad Tag
